on the server side now I have urls corrsponding to every UAV.
I will store those URLs in a filr like:

1
http://server'sip:8080
2
http://server's ip:8081


and so on.

now I will make i different server which stores the content in the string array like:

s[0]=1;
s[1]=http://server's ip:8080
s[2]=2;
s[3]=http://server's ip:8081

and so on.

then it will listen for cleint's request , do some authentication and send that string to the client.

on that client side,

he gets an array of string  ...right 
so he reads the array and make an array of urls available and store in the array of size n/2

like 

arr[0]=s[1];
arr[1]=s[3];

then it will make n/2 buttons and corresponding to each button it will have action performed to play that url in the vlc media player.


command for multiple streaming
