GOAL:

establishing telemetry link over internet(3G or wifi)

situation: we have several uavs flying at serveral different places.We want a user to be able to access telemetry  data(monitor and control ) any available uav.

SOLUTION:

we developed 3 tier architecture to solve this problem 

WE have a source: runs mavproxy.py to send UDP packet of the flying data to the server

We have a server: receives UDP packets from sources at different ports and run mavproxy to send the data of corresponding uav to the specifoed client.

We have client:
Client uses Qgroundcontrol software.It has login for the user.On authentication User gets no of uavs available , then user selects the uav whose data he wants and get the corresponding data from the server.
